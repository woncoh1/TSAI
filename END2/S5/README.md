Session 5 - First Hands On

## Assignment Instructions

- Look at [this code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19wZi7P0Tzq9ZxeMz5EDmzfWFBLFWe6kN?usp=sharing&pli=1&authuser=0) above. It has additional details on "Back Translate", i.e. using Google translate to convert the sentences. It has "random_swap" function, as well as "random_delete". 

- Use "Back Translate", "random_swap" and "random_delete" to augment the data you are training on

- Download the StanfordSentimentAnalysis Dataset from [this link](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/stanfordSentimentTreebank.zip)(it might be troubling to download it, so force download on chrome). Use "**datasetSentences.txt**" and "**sentiment_labels.txt**" files from the zip you just downloaded as your dataset. This dataset contains just over 10,000 pieces of Stanford data from HTML files of Rotten Tomatoes. The sentiments are rated between 1 and 25, where one is the most negative and 25 is the most positive.

- Train your model and achieve **60%+ validation/test accuracy**. Upload your collab file on GitHub with readme that contains details about your assignment/word (minimum **250 words**), **training logs showing final validation accuracy, and outcomes for 10 example inputs from the test/validation data**.

- **You must submit before DUE date (and not "until" date)**.
